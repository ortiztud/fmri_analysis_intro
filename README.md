# PsyMsc4. Introduction to fMRI: methods and analysis.


This is a hands-on workshop on fMRI analysis for the PsyMSc4 at the Goethe University. The workshops will cover **which** are the necessary and common steps when conducting fMRI research and **how** to run them with MATLAB's SPM. The core Philosophy of the workshop is that one of the main skills that a cognitive neuroscientist should have is the ability to judge what **can** and what **cannot** be done with fMRI experiments from a conceptual level. In order to acquire such a skill, one needs to *understand* fMRI research , i.e., to know the basics of the technique itself and the logic behind the most common analysis.

The workshop is structured in six sessions of about 4 hours each. Each session will be dedicated to a specific processing or analysis step. Sessions 1 - 5 will start with theory and logic behind that day's step and will continue with a hands-on exercise. Session 6 will be dedicated to students' presentations on their work.

## Theoretical topics:

We will aim at covering the sequential steps from getting the raw MR images to reporting group-level univariate results. We will also briefly discuss most common multivariate analysis techniques.

- Basics of fMRI
- Preprocessing
- General Linear Models
- Contrast analysis
- Group analysis and reports
- Multivariate

## Hands-on activities

- Generating condition files from BIDS
- Running GLM with SPM
- Generating contrast maps
- Running group-level analysis
- Reportting results
